Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?

-->Object is a most importand data-type (is a reference data type) and it is bulding a blocks for JavaScript.

-->JavaScript primitive data types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) all are store a single value.

-->Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair.

	Ex: let ob = {property1:value1, property2:value2}

-->Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables except for the attachment to objects.  

--> Access the propertie values by using object name. The property name are case sensitive.

For Example 

	ObjectName.PropertyName

	var stud = new Object();
	stud.Name ='Test1';
	stud.Age = 28;
